<p>This last year was the Year of the Snake in the Chinese Zodiac.
According to superstition, it’s supposed to be a bad year for me.
I broke my one of my tooth and had to get it removed (after a failed attempt to try to save it).
My team at work got downsized, and I decided to move to the security team.
And finally, although I did reach my reading goal this year,
I was in a reading slump all year.
The best thing I read were <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/244606-the-shapes-trilogy">The Shapes Trilogy</a>
by Mac Barnett and Jon Klassen.
Anyways, it was not a great year personally, but I felt like my personal problems were
eclipsed by things happening in the world
(which I won’t get into here).</p>
<p>As mentioned above, I switched to the security team this year.
With all the vibe coding going on in the industry,
I was thinking that it would mean that secure design would be more important.
So when the opportunity to join the security team was available,
I decided it was a good move to help me develop skills around secure software design.
Anyways, it’s hard to predict where the industry is headed,
but doing more security probably wouldn’t really hurt my career.
Plus I find it interesting.</p>
<p>I started cycling to work because the TTC was a mess this summer.
Taking transit sometimes took almost exactly the same amount of time as walking home.
So I decided to brave the streets of Toronto and go on my bike.
I haven’t died so far, so that’s promising.</p>
<p>We went to Banff and Drumheller during the summer.
Banff was really expensive, but also quite beautiful.
Drumheller was all about dinosaurs,
and a good family trip for young children
(nice desert hikes, dinosaur museums and kitschy dinosaur town).
It’s also amazing to see the geographical diversity within one province,
where you can go from alpine mountains to rocky desert within a 6 hour drive.</p>
<p>The last notable thing that happened to me was that I got a new phone.
My last phone lasted from 2019 to 2025.
The only reason to replace the old Huawei P30 Lite was that it did not support NFC
(for a bunch of virtual cards that I wanted to use it for)
and that my model did not support various 5Ghz WiFi bands that are in North America
(so it was a hit or miss connecting based on router configurations).
Anyways, I’ve beaten my previous record for how long I’ve had my phone before replacing
(which was 5 years for my Nexus 5).</p>
<p>Some goals for the next year:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read 52 books</li>
<li>Attempt to get a security certification</li>
<li>Write a chapter a week (I’m still working on that wuxia novel)</li>
</ul>
